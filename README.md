# OXIDO recruitment task

## About
The goal of the project is to create a simple application in JavaScript that automates article text processing using the OpenAI API. The application reads a text file with an article, processes its contents using the AI model, and then writes the resulting HTML in the file `artikul.html`. The HTML code generated by OpenAI includes the appropriate structure of headings and sections, as well as suggested places for graphics, but no additional CSS or JavaScript code.

In addition to the main HTML file, the project also includes two optional files:

- `szablon.html` – this file is an empty HTML template containing basic styles, designed for previewing the processed article.

- `podglad.html` – this file is generated by the script based on `szablon.html` and contains a complete preview of the article, with the content from `artykul.html` embedded in the body section.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js v20.11.1

## How to run

1. Environment Variables

   - Create `.env.local` file based on the [.env](./.env) file. Without it, the application will not run.

2. Install modules

   - Run in terminal command `npm i` to install dependencies.

3. Run app

   - At the end run command `npm run start`. It will create HTML files in [output](./output/) folder.
